# Machine-Learning-Assignments

**This project is only for SWJTU's students providing their assignments.**

Please upload your source code in zip file format and name it with your ID and name, e.g.ï¼Œ ID-NAME.

Do not worry that others could copy your codes, cos we will check the source code and there is no too much spare time for them to plagiarize.

*HINT: Please ask your classmate's help to upload your assignment if you can not connect to the GitHub website.*

# Experimental data set
There are three MNIST datasets involved in this experiment, which are stored in the data folder;
The data file in MNIST folder is used for training and testing pytorch neural network model;
mnist.npz is used to test and train the decision tree model;
Two CSV files are used to test and train SVM model;
The data set used by random forest is directly downloaded and used through tensorflow internal data.
